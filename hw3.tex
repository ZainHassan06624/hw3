\question[10]
  The following is a murder case solved by Sherlock Holmes, in “A Study
  in Scarlet” :\\
  \textit{“And now we come to the great question as to the reason why. Robbery
    has not been the object of the murder, for nothing was taken. Was it
    politics, then, or was it a woman?  That is the question which confronted
    me. I was inclined from the first to the latter supposition. Political
    assassins are only too glad to do their work and fly. This murder had, on
    the contrary, been done most deliberately, and the perpetrator has left
    his tracks all over the room, showing he had been
    there all the time.”}\\
  From these, Sherlock Holmes concluded: ``It was a woman''.  Translate the
  above argument to statements in predicate logic and prove its validity.

    The relation given is not an equivalence relation as it is not transitive. Assuming (x,y,z) to be (-3,0,1) then yz $\geq 0$, xy $\geq 0$ but not for xz as -3 is less than 0

    It is not symmetric and hence does not an equivalence relation
    \part

  \begin{EnvUplevel}
    Let $R$ be a relation from a set A to a set B. The \textit{inverse relation} from $B$ to $A$, denoted by $R^{-1}$, is the set of ordered pairs $\{(b, a) \mid (a, b) \in R\}$. The \textit{complementary relation} $\overline{R}$ is the set of ordered pairs $\{(a, b) \mid (a, b) \not\in R\}$. A relation $R$ on the set $A$ is \textit{irreflexive} if $\forall a \in A\colon (a, a) \not\in R$. That is, $R$ is irreflexive if no element in $A$ is related to itself.
